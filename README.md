# github trending spider
Tracking the most popular Github repos that are generated within a week or a month or a quarter. Sorted by stars and forks in descending order. Updated daily!!🍻

### What's different from the official [github-trending](https://github.com/trending) ?
* The official focus is on which repos have **the most stars growth** over a period of time
* The project is to find some popular repos that are generated within a week or a month or a quarter, sorted by stars and forks

### 与官方的 [github-trending](https://github.com/trending) 有何区别：
* 官方 trending 的重点在于某段时间，哪些项目的 stars **增长最多**
* 此项目是想找到在一周或一个月或一季度内出现的最有趣的 **新项目**，并根据 stars 和 forks 排序

PS: 主要是想看看最近出了哪些有意思的新项目，欢迎提建议 :)
